A small angular project to display information about my commute.

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```
sh
$ git clone git://github.com/garnertb/commute
$ cd commute
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/commute/build/index.html` in your browser.


## Purpose

`commute` is designed to make my commute easier by providing a heads up display of
information before I leave.  I wrote this application to learn [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
and [NG-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) without the expectation that it will be
useful for anyone else.
